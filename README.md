# CSE_Project_Backend

CSE_Project
This Project was made for a Mobile Device Programming Class.
We build an app, that is already in the App Store and is called HappyCow. You can search vegetarian or vegan restaurants based on a map.

TypeScrip source code is in ./src
JavaScript source code us in ./dist

Translate TypeScipt to JavaScript run "npm run build"
Enable build watch (automaticlly compiles TS to JS) "npm run watch.build"
